Welcome!

If you haven't gone to the [Member Portal](/member) to download The ConvexValue Terminal, then go ahead and do that.

Then - you can watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/KGh1Ifp9d0Q" target="_blank">flash tutorial</a> which jams everything into 3 minutes.

That might be all you need to begin operating The ConvexValue Terminal. We also have a more comprehensive <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1U1sZz8HSDTIxy6eE14ZA-dBPcRcV_T&si=V8JJfgjZuxAmJ9TK" target="_blank">tutorial series</a> which goes into more detail.

Both the flash tutorial and the series will teach you how to create dashboards, how to split-panes, configure modules, save, share, clone dashboards, etc.

However, you aren't here just to play around with the Terminal. The Terminal is just a tool, the goal is the market.

To learn the various ways you can utilize the Terminal to gain market insight, make trades, form hypothesis and understand market movement - [The Hub](/hub) contains posts ranging from tutorials to analysis, to updates.

Any questions, issues, feedback - anything! - I am at your service.

Thank you for giving ConvexValue a shot!
