To understand what we aim to do with The ConvexValue Terminal - let's first picture the status quo.

## Status Quo

There are plenty of options analytics tools. Both "free" and paid.

### "Free" and Paid Tools

The "free" tools aren't really "free" - nothing is. You are paying with your eyeballs and attention. Their business model relies on ads. You have to navigate through heaps of extracurricular content to find what you are looking for.

Why are you forced to download megabytes of ads and news reels just to see the market cap of AAPL ?

It is a strain on your computer resources and your eyes.

Paid tools don't tend to suffer from this issue - you are paying for it upfront.

However, due to the nature of delivering options data - you are most likely overpaying.

There are high costs involved in licenses and infrastructure - and providers are often forced to rely on high markups to operate their businesses profitably.

Some of these paid tools are very good - but they rarely cover all your needs. Which means you need other paid tools that are often redundant.

This is the problem you knew you had - but there is another one you didn't know.

### The Browser

All of these tools are *web-apps* that you run on your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc). They are usually designed as full-blown apps intended to occupy your entire screen space. But you aren't usually using just one of them in the entire screen.

You are often using many. This means you have many browser tabs and windows scattered around the screen running many more processes than you need.

This clutter is distracting.

But even worse - it doesn't let you organize your research and trade ideas, or share with others. The browser wasn't built for this.

### The Result

The result is the following:

You are getting your tools and data from an assortment of free and paid tools, overpaying for multiple and redundant subscriptions, in a jarring customer experience due to having to navigate and manage so many different sites.

This all happens in a haystack of browser tabs and windows impossible to organize.

But there is a better way.
